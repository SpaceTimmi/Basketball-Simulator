# Basketball simulator

Inspired by [Forest Knight's Wrestling Simulator](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/Wrestling-Simulation), I am going to make a similar simulator but this time for basketball. Special thanks to the [NBA API by SWar Patel](https://github.com/swar/nba_api). I will be using their API to gather data for the current NBA players so I can use their up-to-date data for the simulation.

Info used in schdeuling the simulator to the similar to the NBA schedule thanks to NBA []()
